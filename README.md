This repository contains three simple C# console applications designed to practice basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, user input handling, and loops.

# Applications Included
- Grade Calculator
- Ticket Price Calculator
- Triangle Type Identifier

# Grade Calculator
This program prompts the user to enter a numerical grade between 0 and 100. It then displays the corresponding letter grade based on the following scale:

90 and above: A
80 - 89: B
70 - 79: C
60 - 69: D
Below 60: F

Features:
- Validates user input for grades.
- Displays clear results based on grading scale.

# Ticket Price Calculator
This program calculates the price of a movie ticket. The standard ticket price is GHC 10.
If the customer is a senior citizen (age 65 or above) or a child (age 12 or below), they receive a discounted price of GHC 7.

Features:
- Prompts the user for their age.
- Calculates ticket price based on age.
- Displays the applicable discount and final price.

# Triangle Type Identifier
This program prompts the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Based on the inputs, it determines and displays the type of triangle:
- Equilateral: All three sides are equal.
- Isosceles: Two sides are equal.
- Scalene: All sides are different.

Features:
- Accepts user input for three sides of a triangle.
- Classifies and displays the triangle type.
